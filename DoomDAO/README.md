This code is for a Doomsday DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) smart contract that extends the ERC721 NFT standard and the Ownable contract from OpenZeppelin. The DoomsdayDAO allows users to mint NFTs that represent key roles that are critical in a doomsday scenario, such as Emergency Services, Search and Rescue, Engineering and Construction, Logistics and Supply Chain Management, Communication and Information Technology, Security and Law Enforcement, Psychological Support and Counseling, and Social and Community Services.

The NFT structure includes an ID, an owner, and a key role. The NFTs are stored in a mapping that maps the NFT ID to the NFT structure. The total supply of NFTs is limited to 100, and a maximum and minimum minting price are set at 1 ether and 0.1 ether, respectively.

The smart contract has three main functions. The first function, mintNFT(), allows users to mint an NFT by sending ether to the contract. The function requires that the maximum supply of NFTs has not been reached and that the payment sent is greater than or equal to the current minting price. The NFT is minted and assigned to the user, and the NFT ID, owner, and key role are stored in the mapping. An event is also emitted to track the minting of the NFT. The payment sent by the user is transferred to the DAO wallet.

The second function, setMintingPrice(), allows the owner of the contract to set a new minting price within the range of the minimum and maximum prices.

The third function, setDaoWallet(), allows the owner to set a new DAO wallet address that will receive the payments sent by users when minting NFTs. The withdraw() function allows the owner to withdraw the balance of the contract to the DAO wallet.

Some possible improvements could include adding more functionality to the DAO, such as allowing users to vote on important decisions, adding more key roles to the enum, and adding more security features to prevent malicious attacks.
