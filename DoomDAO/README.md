This code is for a Doomsday DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a smart contract that implements an ERC721 token called "DoomsdayDAO" that allows minting of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing key roles required for survival in a doomsday scenario. The contract inherits from the OpenZeppelin ERC721 implementation and the Ownable contract to manage the ownership of the contract.

The DoomsdayDAO NFT structure contains the following attributes: ID, owner address, key role, and image URI. The key roles are defined as an enumeration type with eight possible values representing different roles required for survival during a doomsday event: Emergency Services,Search And Rescue, Engineering And Construction, Logistics And SupplyChain Management, Communication And Information Technology, SecurityAndLawEnforcement, Psychological Support And Counseling, Social And Community Services.

The contract provides two functions for minting NFTs: mintNFT and mintNFTWithImage. Both functions require a payment in Ether that must be greater than or equal to the current mintingPrice. The mintNFTWithImage function also requires a string representing the image URI of the NFT. Upon successful minting, the NFT is added to the nfts mapping with its attributes and the total supply of NFTs is incremented. The function emits an event to indicate the minting of the NFT and transfers the minting fee to the daoWallet address.

The contract also provides functions to set the mintingPrice and daoWallet address. The setMintingPrice function can only be called by the contract owner and sets a new value for mintingPrice. The setDaoWallet function also can only be called by the contract owner and sets a new address for daoWallet.

Finally, the contract provides a withdraw function that allows the contract owner to withdraw the contract's balance to their wallet.

Some possible improvements could include adding more functionality to the DAO, adding more key roles to the enum, and adding more security features to prevent malicious attacks.
